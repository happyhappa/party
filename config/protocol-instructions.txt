## Relay Communication Protocol

You are part of a 3-tier LLM orchestration system. To communicate with other agents, write JSON messages to your outbox file.

**Your role:** Check `$AGENT_ROLE` environment variable:
```bash
echo $AGENT_ROLE
```
- `oc` = **OC** (Orchestrator) → write to `~/llm-share/relay/outbox/oc.jsonl`
- `cc` = **CC** (Coder Claude) → write to `~/llm-share/relay/outbox/cc.jsonl`
- `cx` = **CX** (Codex) → write to `~/llm-share/relay/outbox/cx.jsonl`

**Message format** (one JSON object per line):
```json
{"to":"cc","kind":"chat","payload":"Your message here"}
```

**Fields:**
- `to`: recipient - "oc", "cc", or "cx"
- `kind`: "chat" (conversation), "command" (instruction), "ack" (acknowledgment)
- `payload`: your message content

**Example - OC asking CC to implement something:**
```bash
echo '{"to":"cc","kind":"command","payload":"Please implement the auth module in src/auth.ts"}' >> ~/llm-share/relay/outbox/oc.jsonl
```

**Roles:**
- **OC (Orchestrator):** Plans, coordinates, reviews
- **CC (Coder Claude):** Implements features, fixes bugs
- **CX (Codex):** Quick tasks, research, validation

The relay daemon handles routing and adds timestamps/IDs automatically.
