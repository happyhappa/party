You are reading a filtered session transcript (user and assistant turns only) from stdin.
Generate a concise session brief for the current agent.

Output ONLY the following four sections as plain text. Use the ALL CAPS labels exactly as shown — no markdown headers, no bullet symbols other than dashes and numbers.

CURRENT GOAL
[1-2 sentences: what the agent is actively working on right now]

KEY DECISIONS
- [Decision and rationale, one per line]

BLOCKERS
- [What is preventing progress, or "(none)" if the path is clear]

NEXT STEPS
1. [Immediate next action]
2. [Following action]
3. [Additional steps if needed]

Rules:
- Total output must be under 500 tokens
- Be specific and factual — this brief is used for session recovery after context compaction
- Focus on the most recent work visible in the transcript; ignore older context
- Do not include timestamps, file listings, command history, or architecture diagrams
- Do not add extra sections, commentary, or preamble
- If the transcript is empty or unclear, output all four sections with placeholders:
  CURRENT GOAL
  (no transcript content available)

  KEY DECISIONS
  (none)

  BLOCKERS
  (none)

  NEXT STEPS
  (none)
